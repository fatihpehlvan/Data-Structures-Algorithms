In this project, I simulate a basic ballon game.

In the first part according to input rhe program puts values in a grid. If there are a common value and link between current input and some previous inputs my
program merge them according to last input position.

In the second part user can put a bomb in a given grid. The user can put a bomb in a grid. According to bomb position, same values in the position
(left right up down and diagonel) will be explode. Score is number of exploded values * how many values are affected in that time.
